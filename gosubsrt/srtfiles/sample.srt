1
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:20,690
Ah! Fuck. Yeah, it doesn't matter.

2
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,470
Whoa. You okay there, Richard?

3
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,000
Uh, yeah, I'm fine.

4
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,200
Sorry, I can't really throw it any slower.

5
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:27,610
Give it another cut, Richard.

6
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:29,510
No, I'm fine. I don't want to.

7
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:31,840
Maybe someone else wants to. Who's next?

8
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:34,850
If someone has to go, I'll go,
but it seems very frightening.

9
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,880
You sure? You got us for the whole hour.

10
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:40,280
- Anyone?
- Would it hurt your feelings if no one went?

11
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,350
Man on P.A.: Ladies and gentlemen,

12
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:46,620
welcome to the annual
Stern-Taylor fall classic.

13
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:50,880
I'd like to start by making a toast
to our very special guest tonight,

14
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,750
Richard Hendricks.

15
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:54,850
Richard, after your perfect game

16
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,520
at TechCrunch Disrupt a few weeks ago,

17
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,660
we fell in love with you and your tech.

18
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:02,120
Look, we know everyone in
the Valley is after you,

19
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:06,070
and we know that you're probably
going to go with Peter Gregory,

20
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:09,000
but we'd love to have you
come play on our team.

21
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,840
Let Stern-Taylor Capital Fund
in on your Series A financing,

22
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,880
because together, Richard, we'd be...

23
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:19,180
a home... run!

24
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,720
- Oh, right.
- What do you say, Richard?

25
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:28,160
I'll... I'll do what I can.

26
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:30,690
All right.

27
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:32,230
Have fun, everybody.

28
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:36,530
I don't know, man. It's
starting to feel weird

29
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,760
letting all these firms suck up to us, even
though we're not gonna take their money.

30
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:43,860
Richard, Peter Gregory hasn't
officially given us the term sheet yet.

31
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,930
Yes, but he will tomorrow when he gets back.

32
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,060
If you can't enjoy this many people

33
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:49,970
kissing our ass at this level,

34
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,600
then I feel sorry for you.

35
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:54,770
Would you just relax and
take it in for a second?

36
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:58,270
I mean, we are getting our
dicks sucked at the AT&T Park.

37
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:02,680
We're standing on the field
of the World Series champions.

38
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:06,610
- It's totally lost on me.
- Yeah, I don't give a shit, either.

39
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:09,520
Hey! I'm Nicole Stein.

40
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:11,550
I lead the Growth Team at Stern-Taylor.

41
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:14,250
- Oh, I'm Dinesh.
- I'm Gilfoyle.

42
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:17,420
I love it. So what do
you two do at Pied Piper?

43
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:21,200
- I'm the CTO.
- Ha ha, he's joking. I'm the CTO.

44
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:23,090
Fuck you, I'm joking.

45
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:25,590
Okay, how could you be the
Chief Technology Officer?

46
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:29,900
I get it. You hear the word "chief,"
and you think "Indian Chief."

47
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:33,230
- but you're the other kind of Indian.
- Okay. One, Fuck you.

48
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:36,730
I'm Pakistani. And two, how
could you be CTO of anything?

49
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:39,470
You have to be able to organize, you have to
be able to delegate, and you have to be...

50
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:43,910
I delegate you to go get me a
fucking beer while I talk to Nicole.

51
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:47,350
George Silver, operating
partner at Stern-Taylor.

52
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:50,890
So, what do you do at Pied Piper?

53
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,390
He's the CTO.

54
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:00,830
That's Drew Houston. We've been circling
each other for the last 20 minutes.

55
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:04,000
Ooh, the Winklevoss twins.

56
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:06,640
Look at them. They're like two
genetically enhanced Ken dolls.

57
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:09,170
Do you know how much bitcoin they're worth?

58
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:11,570
Oh, shit, they're splitting up.

59
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:13,680
Cameron's the left dominant one, right?

60
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:15,880
- I can't tell them apart.
- I'm gonna come at him from the right side,

61
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:19,010
try and herd them back
together without spooking them.

62
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:22,480
Watch this. Cameron! Cameron!

63
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:27,280
- Okay.
- Well, well, well, look who's the big swinging dick.

64
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:30,150
Hey, Javeed, everything okay at Goolybib?

65
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:32,990
You gotta ask them. They canned me.

66
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:36,550
- What?
- Yeah, our investors got spooked

67
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:39,720
by a possible down round, so they
shoved an acquisition down my throat.

68
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:43,120
Yeah, an acquisition of $200 million, right?

69
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:47,160
Yeah, they all made out. I had
a reverse vest with no triggers,

70
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:50,690
then I lost all my shares when they fired me.

71
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:53,160
I blew my whole signing
bonus renting that house.

72
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:55,160
I'm looking into suing 'em.

73
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,400
- Jeez.
- Look, all I can say is,

74
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:01,110
don't get fucked, all right?

75
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,770
You take money from the wrong dudes,

76
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,800
and you'll get smoked as bad as I did.

77
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,060
Just be careful. Everyone
is watching you now.

78
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:10,900
Yeah. Totally. I know. Thanks, Javeed.

79
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:15,540
No, I mean they're watching you right now.

80
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,140
Oh yeah.

81
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:22,110
Damn it. Where is that camera?

Dinesh: I can't believe how
many gifts we're getting.

84
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:36,070
Gilfoyle: Gifts I'm getting.

85
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,440
That Oculus rig is addressed to the CTO.

86
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:39,970
No, I'm the CTO.

87
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:43,140
As your superior, I order
you to give me that Oculus.

88
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:45,850
You can't make me do stuff.
You're not the boss of me.

89
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,810
- Actually, I am the boss of you.
- Okay.

90
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:51,050
- Richard, tell him I'm CTO.
- Dinesh: You already told that fat guy that I'm the CTO.

91
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:53,660
Stop, stop, stop. Please stop.

92
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:55,590
I have a ton of work to
do. You have work to do.

93
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:58,060
Maybe let's do the work instead of that.

94
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,600
Jared, we were supposed
to get a term sheet today.

95
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:04,000
Have we heard from Peter Gregory?

96
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:07,570
- Peter Gregory is dead.
- What?

97
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:17,440
Holy shit.

98
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:29,920
He was the smartest, shrewdest...

99
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:33,430
strangest man I've ever known.

100
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:37,160
I can't believe that he's gone.

101
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:41,030
Can I asked what happened?

102
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:44,170
Yeah. He was...

103
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,240
in the Serengeti on safari...

104
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,870
- Ah.
- and he had just gone into his tent

105
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:51,740
when a hippo wandered into the camp.

106
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:54,080
Oh, wow.

107
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:55,880
He was attacked by a hippo?

108
00:05:55,910 --> 00:06:00,680
No, I guess the hippo started to charge

109
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,150
when the guide grabbed his
rifle and shot at it, but...

110
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:08,160
his aim was off, and...

111
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:12,860
And he shot Peter Gregory by accident?

112
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,500
- Yeah.
- No, he... he missed...

113
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:20,540
but I guess the sound of the
gun startled Peter, who...

114
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:24,310
ran out of his tent and...

115
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:26,910
Ran right into the hippo?

116
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:30,580
No, the hippo was also startled by the noise

117
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:34,950
and had run off prior to
Peter exiting his tent.

118
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:40,690
So, what happened to Peter?

119
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:45,660
He hadn't run in a long time,

120
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:50,470
maybe ever, and you know, he just...

121
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,930
That was it.

122
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:05,040
- Oh, that is so...
- very strange.

123
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,410
- Very sad and tragic.
- Very sad and strange.

124
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:08,280
Richard: Wow.

125
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:12,130
See ya.

126
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,290
Man, that is so weird. I mean,
one minute Peter Gregory is here,

127
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:18,160
- the next, he's just gone.
- Jared, it's Erlich.

128
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,460
I need you to set up all
the other VC meetings, ASAP.

129
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,030
Line 'em up nuts to butts.

130
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:25,930
What are you doing? Monica just
said they're still gonna fund us.

131
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:28,430
- We should just sit tight.
- Look, I loved Peter Gregory

132
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:30,470
maybe even more than he loved me,

133
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:32,370
but there's something you need to know here,

134
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,380
something that Monica isn't
exactly volunteering up,

135
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:38,040
and that's all of these one-man
firms have a key man clause.

136
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,680
- Do you know what that means?
- No.

137
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:42,140
It means that now that Peter Gregory is gone,

138
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:46,420
all the Raviga investors have the
contractual right to cash out and walk away,

139
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:49,590
which means that by the end of the
day, there may not be a Raviga.

140
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:52,690
- Seriously?
- Yes, so we have to prepare for that.

141
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:55,960
Now, I know that it makes me
sound like a terrible person,

142
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:57,630
but we have a company to
run. And do you know who

143
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:59,370
the first person to agree with me would be?

144
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,870
Peter Gregory.

145
00:08:02,613 --> 00:08:09,328
_

146
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:12,250
Woman: And that is the very first spot

147
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,780
in our new campaign heralding
the upcoming release

148
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:17,350
of Nucleus this January at CES.

149
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:19,780
- Any questions?
- I have a question.

150
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:24,620
That was horrible. I just got
humiliated by a fucking teenager

151
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:28,160
at TechCrunch Disrupt, and
you give me this tampon ad?

152
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:31,830
- A girl with diabetes on a swing?
- I think she has cancer.

153
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,930
At least that's how I read it.

154
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,790
I don't care what kind of disease she had!

155
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:40,030
All I care about is that Nucleus
is better than Pied Piper.

156
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:42,200
Hendricks just left us all in the dust.

157
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:46,740
If we get this wrong, we could blow
the business opportunity of a lifetime!

158
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:49,410
Data creation is exploding.

159
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,880
With all the selfies and useless files

160
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:54,650
people refuse to delete on the cloud,

161
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:57,150
92% of the world's data

162
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:59,950
was created in the last two years alone.

163
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:02,830
At the current rate, the
world's data storage capacity

164
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:05,220
will be overtaken by next spring.

165
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:07,220
It will be nothing short of a catastrophe.

166
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:11,900
Data shortages, data
rationing, data black markets.

167
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:15,270
Someone's compression will save
the world from data-geddon,

168
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:19,570
and it sure as hell better be
Nucleus and not goddamn Pied Piper!

169
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:22,210
I don't know about you people,

170
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,650
but I don't wanna live in
a world where someone else

171
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:28,380
makes the world a better
place better than we do.

172
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,130
"Data-geddon." Is he married to that, or...?

173
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:39,260
There's just been a lot of "geddons" lately.

174
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:42,440
That's true. "Snow-mageddon," "Car-mageddon."

175
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:44,540
There's that movie "Armageddon."

176
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,680
Laurie, you wanted to see me?

177
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,990
Monica, come in, come in.
I'm sure you've heard by now

178
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:55,720
that I've been named our
new managing partner.

179
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,630
Yes. Congratulations.

180
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:01,120
Did the limited partners tell
you how they made their decision?

181
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:03,430
Oh, they looked at the portfolio performances

182
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:05,900
of each of the senior partners
over the last several funds,

183
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:08,130
and my numbers were,
objectively, the most favorable.

184
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:12,440
- Therefore, I was selected.
- Yeah, it's just managing partner

185
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:17,010
is all about meeting with people
and interacting with people.

186
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:18,780
You can sit down if you
want to. Do you want to?

187
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:20,180
- Oh.
- Or should we stand?

188
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:22,780
Uh, I... whatever... I'm standing...

189
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,390
- Okay.
- But you don't have to.

190
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:27,490
- Okay.
- Would it make you feel awkward to sit?

191
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:29,730
I'm okay to stand.

192
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:33,400
Monica... Of course.

193
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,470
Peter Gregory is dead.

194
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:38,140
Yes, I know.

195
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:42,280
On a personal note, his death is very sad.

196
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:45,150
But on a professional level, it's untenable.

197
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:46,480
I've been reviewing his files.

198
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,110
He was pursuing a number of
extremely dubious positions.

199
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:54,020
Are you aware that we own a $30
million ostrich farm in Morocco,

200
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:56,330
or that we are the majority stakeholders

201
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:59,670
in three companies that
specialize in invisibility?

202
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:03,310
This box is filled with
napkins covered with notes

203
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:07,310
detailing Peter's conviction that
genetically-modified cranberry fungus

204
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:11,090
- would become the next cotton.
- That... That one I remember, yes.

205
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,790
- Monica.
- Mm-hmm.

206
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:16,120
Peter Gregory is dead.

207
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,689
- Yes.
- We need to seem competitive,

208
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:23,090
now more than ever, to our investors
as well as to the industry at large.

209
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:28,310
Well, I mean, Pied Piper is probably the
hottest early investment in town right now,

210
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:31,380
- and we have them.
- Do we?

211
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:34,210
But why then are they speaking to other firms

212
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,480
- about investing in their Series A?
- No, no, I just told them

213
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:40,050
to sit tight for a day or two
until we sorted things out.

214
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:44,360
It seems that that advanced
a sense of uncertainty,

215
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:46,490
and now we're at risk of losing their round.

216
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:49,100
This could jeopardize the firm

217
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:53,470
and, by extension, your career here,
Monica, as an associate partner.

218
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:57,340
- Well, I guess I was just kind of in shock.
- Monica...

219
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,210
Peter Gregory is dead.

220
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:07,920
Yes. I know.

221
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:10,190
This is great.

222
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:13,020
Do you know how many times
I've gone into these rooms

223
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:15,690
with nothing but a half of an ass in my hand?

224
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:21,830
We're walking in there with three-foot
cocks covered in Elvis dust.

225
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:24,330
- Really?
- Richard Hendricks? They're ready for you.

226
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:27,740
- This is a fucking layup, guys.
- Okay, let's do this.

227
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:31,710
Not you, Jared.

228
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:35,610
Now, with proper funding, we
should be able to put together

229
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:38,250
a functioning beta in time for CES

230
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:42,750
and compress Nucleus out of the marketplace.

231
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:47,730
Yeah.

232
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,130
I don't know.

233
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,830
You don't... What?

234
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:54,830
It just doesn't seem worked out to me.

235
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:59,570
Well, I mean, it was worked out
enough to win TechCrunch Disrupt.

236
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:02,370
Yes, and congratulations, you won 50 grand,

237
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:05,680
but you're asking us for 200 times that.

238
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:09,010
Richard, look, we all
know about your amazing...

239
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:12,660
compression rate, but
let's not be naive here.

240
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:16,290
You can't expect to just
throw money at an algorithm

241
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,730
and beat one of the largest
tech companies in the world,

242
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,860
so why don't you rework this a little

243
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,970
and come back in with a little more?

244
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,930
Maybe next week?

245
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:31,500
- And?
- That was really weird.

246
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:34,870
I guess we don't have as much
Elvis dust on us as I thought.

247
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:37,310
You see? This is why I wanted
to go with Peter Gregory.

248
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:40,350
This is bullshit. That guy
throws this huge party for us

249
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,150
and then acts like he doesn't even want us?

250
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:46,050
I fucking hate parties. And he's just,
"Come back next week when you have more."

251
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,950
More? More than 5.2 on Weissman?

252
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:50,280
No. No.

253
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,180
Fuck that guy. Fuck this
place. Fuck this whole place.

254
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:56,520
- Watch me fuck this place.
- No, wait! Wait, wait!

255
00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:01,560
Hey. Remember when you told me
to come back when I had more?

256
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:04,290
And then I said I would?
Well, I'm not going to.

257
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:06,590
Ever. This doesn't count.

258
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:09,470
I'm covered in dust. I'm a three-foot dick,

259
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,930
and I've got half an ass
to go to some other company

260
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:15,280
who's never gonna put me on a
Jumbotron or throw balls at me.

261
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:19,880
Bye.

262
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,820
Are you feeling unwell? Do you need protein?

263
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:31,120
I don't know what happened.

264
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,720
Between Peter dying and
Raviga maybe being gone,

265
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,830
I just... I just wanna get
funded and build Pied Piper.

266
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:38,230
I hate this part.

267
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:40,930
Well, if one thing is for sure...

268
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:43,840
if we're gonna get any traction,
I need to step up my game.

269
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:46,140
It's an email from Ron LaFlamme.

270
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:49,880
"Just got a term sheet from Stern-Taylor.

271
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:51,540
"They offered five million

272
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:54,240
"at 25 million post-money valuation.

273
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:56,940
- "More than I thought."
- Shit. They were negging us.

274
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:59,080
- Negging?
- Negging is going negative.

275
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:02,610
It's a manipulative sex strategy
used by lonely chauvinists.

276
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:05,120
See, everybody wants us.
By shitting all over us,

277
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:07,590
they try and bring our price down,

278
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:09,990
but you shitting all over them

279
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:12,320
counteracted them shitting all over us.

280
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:15,000
You negged a neg. Richard,
this could be good.

281
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:17,860
Where do we have next? Ross-Loma Capital.

282
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:19,630
Should I keep doing it?
Should I keep negging?

283
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:21,100
No, no, I'll handle this.

284
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:23,930
If they want to negotiate
using hostility and rudeness...

285
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:26,770
well, they picked the wrong guy.

286
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:30,420
Well, you see, our main concern

287
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:33,580
is how you're going to achieve escape
velocity on your growth rate...

288
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:36,150
hit critical mass.

289
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:39,120
I'm sorry. What... What's funny?

290
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:41,480
It's just that painting behind you.

291
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,150
It's awful.

292
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:47,290
It looks like harlequin
Kama Sutra done poorly.

293
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,830
So, I agree,

294
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:51,590
bad culture fit.

295
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:55,270
- I think we all just move on.
- Look, I didn't say anything about a culture fit.

296
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:57,040
No, I did.

297
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:59,810
Okay. Well...

298
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,510
thank you for meeting with us.

299
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:03,620
We have a bunch of these things to go to,

300
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:05,750
hopefully with more tasteful artwork,

301
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:09,590
and your logo looks like a sideways vagina.

302
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:12,320
I find that to be racist, don't you?

303
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:18,460
Okay, here's my concern...
Here's my concern...

304
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:21,090
Who the hell picked out that shirt for you?

305
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:24,000
- What?
- Oh, I see.

306
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:27,000
With the pants, so I guess it's a whole...

307
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,570
- thing.
- My wife picked these out.

308
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:31,140
Then you married poorly.

309
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:34,540
Do you care about Pied Piper?

310
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:37,450
Do I care about Pied Piper? Well, of course.

311
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,880
'Cause if you do, I'm not seeing it.

312
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:43,450
In fact, what I think I'm
seeing is the human equivalent

313
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:44,990
of a "flassid" penis.

314
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:48,500
"Flak-sid." It's actually
pronounced "flak-sid."

315
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:49,990
Not a lot of people know that.

316
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:51,830
Well, we are definitely interested,

317
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:54,430
but I think we need to...

318
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:56,970
I'm sorry. Is something wrong?

319
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,530
No, this is... all wrong.

320
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:02,700
I am sensing a general lack of vision.

321
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:05,080
Your muffins smell like shit.

322
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:06,770
So do your ideas.

323
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:10,380
One of you is the least
attractive person I've ever seen,

324
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:12,280
and I'm not gonna say who.

325
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:16,020
Should we leave or should you?

326
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:19,190
We just got offered eight at 40.

327
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:21,130
We're five for five, gentlemen.

328
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:23,800
And Galveston Capital Fund and
Yountville Ventures called.

329
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,970
They want to move their meetings
up before everyone else.

330
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:28,670
Hey, let me try. I want to
be rude at this next one.

331
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:30,080
Go for it.

332
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:31,710
So, with some proper funding,

333
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:34,750
we should be able to get a
functioning beta in time for CES.

334
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:37,350
And if you don't fund us,

335
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,550
you're a fucking slut.

336
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:45,590
Ah. What's that smell?

337
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:48,760
Is that a fart? You... Are you a farter?

338
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:54,200
Now, can I have a pastry? Or
are you guys gonna eat 'em all?

339
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,440
'Cause you're gonna get fat.

340
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:03,720
It's not your fault, Richard. This is
just something that can't be taught,

341
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:07,620
so leave the next one to me. I
can feel a big one coming on.

342
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:11,320
- What are you gonna do?
- I'm not sure yet, but give me room.

343
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:13,990
There's something inside
of me that has to come out,

344
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:15,720
and who am I to stop it?

345
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:19,230
His balls?

346
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:21,500
He put his balls on the table?

347
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:23,830
- Right on the table.
- On purpose?

348
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:26,370
I don't see how it could be by accident.

349
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,610
Richard, I just got an email
from the guys at Midland-Oak.

350
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:33,120
Apparently, there is a
line, and I crossed it...

351
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:36,780
The line between $12 and $15 million!

352
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:40,020
Ba-bam! Midland-Oak's offer just came in.

353
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:44,520
Gentlemen, we are valued at
75 million, fully diluted.

354
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:47,290
- Are you shitting me?
- Take a look at these term sheets.

355
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:51,300
There is a linear correlation
between how intolerable I was

356
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:53,190
and the height of valuation.

357
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:57,870
Hey, you guys. This is Laurie Bream,

358
00:18:57,910 --> 00:18:59,870
the new managing partner at Raviga.

359
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:02,510
Hi. I'm Richard Hendricks.

360
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:05,580
Yes. I recognize you from your photograph.

361
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:07,580
It's very nice to meet you in person.

362
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:09,750
- Yeah.
- Okay, so we did that.

363
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:12,050
Gentlemen, I am aware of
the degree of interest

364
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:13,520
you are receiving from other firms.

365
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:16,160
I am aware that participation
in your Series A will require

366
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:19,120
a very competitive offer,
but for numerous reasons,

367
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,630
I believe it to be the prudent decision.

368
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,860
Now I am

369
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:25,670
presenting you with this.

370
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:29,940
20 million at $100 million valuation?

371
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:34,470
- I don't, uh...
- This is way more than any other offer.

372
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:38,210
Correct. That is very much intentional.

373
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,710
So, I believe that
satisfies your requirements?

374
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:43,850
Monica will arrange a time
to formalize the details.

375
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,520
Thank you. Have a good day.

376
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:47,290
Uh, thank you.

377
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,980
Yes.

378
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:52,820
Yes.

379
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:56,220
Congratulations, guys. I am so glad...

380
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:58,730
Oh, shit. She's my ride home.

381
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:01,090
- I'll call you, Richard.
- Yeah, okay.

382
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:04,070
Wait! Laurie, hold on! Thanks for stopping...

383
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:08,070
Guys, I think we're funded.

384
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:10,610
- Yes! Richie!
- Oh, yeah!

385
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:18,080
Erlich: So, I push my dick to the
side, unbutton the bottom buttons,

386
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,490
and bam!

387
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:23,150
- Ah! What are you doing?
- Shit. Sorry, sorry. Sorry.

388
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:26,990
Meet me on the side of the house.

389
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:29,190
- I... okay.
- Okay. Go.

390
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:32,200
- Hey.
- Hey, what's up?

391
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:35,930
If anyone finds out that I came
back here, I will get fired, okay?

392
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,270
Okay.

393
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:40,230
- Don't take this deal.
- What?

394
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:43,030
You are worth half that at best.

395
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:45,530
Oh. Wow. Thanks for the compliment.

396
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:48,330
No. The credit to you guys.
You negotiated your asses off,

397
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:50,740
but this is a classic runaway valuation.

398
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:53,010
What's wrong with that?

399
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:56,050
Pied Piper will be tied
to this crazy valuation

400
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,410
that you will never be able to live up to.

401
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:02,220
If you don't keep increasing
in value in the next round,

402
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:04,660
if you have a down round, you are fucked.

403
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:07,360
It is the kiss of death for a young CEO.

404
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:09,690
You want to start with a realistic valuation

405
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:11,400
and grow at a reasonable pace.

406
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:14,090
Okay, well, if it's such a shitty deal,

407
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:16,100
then why did your boss offer it to us?

408
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:18,070
Because she's as competitive as hell.

409
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:21,370
She needs Pied Piper to
keep Raviga afloat, Richard.

410
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,310
- Okay.
- Look, I respect Laurie,

411
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:26,200
but this is the exact type
of thing Peter never did.

412
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,440
Richard, come on. I own shares in Pied Piper.

413
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:31,270
If this high a valuation
was good in the long-term,

414
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:34,540
would I be standing here, risking my job?

415
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:38,310
Don't take our offer. Maybe go
with the lowest offer you got.

416
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:39,810
Even that might be too high.

417
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,910
Again, thank you for the compliment.

418
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:47,920
Also... I didn't see anything

419
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:49,680
- in there.
- No. Yeah, thank you.

420
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:52,560
I was gonna say if you had,
you'd have to show me yours, too.

421
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,790
Umm...

422
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:59,890
- Okay.
- Okay. Thanks for the...

423
00:22:08,541 --> 00:22:12,462
_

424
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:17,440
Yeah, sorry about that party.

425
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:20,150
I was in kind of a bad way that night.

426
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:23,510
And truth is... I'm actually doing okay.

427
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:25,680
- Good. That's great.
- Yeah.

428
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:28,150
I mean, I could run the scenarios
about what happened all I want,

429
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:31,289
but... I finally just
realized there's just nothing

430
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:32,924
- I could do, you know?
- Yeah. but... I finally just realized there's just nothing

431
00:22:32,925 --> 00:22:34,330
- I could do, you know?
- Yeah.

432
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:37,860
So... I'm at peace with it all.

433
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:40,090
I was thinking, actually...

434
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:43,300
What if you had asked for less?

435
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:47,960
- What?
- Well, what if you could've gone to someone

436
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:50,300
and asked for less than what
they offered that first round?

437
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:53,140
You mean, like, negotiating them down?

438
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:55,210
- Yeah.
- Can... Can you even do that?

439
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:58,810
- Well, yeah. I mean, why not?
- Yeah, but...

440
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:03,270
I mean, I guess, technically, I could have...

441
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:05,640
- Mmm.
- Huh.

442
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:09,710
Yeah, I suppose you could argue
that it might've been easier

443
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:13,250
to hit more realistic benchmarks

444
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:16,380
- and reach cash flow break-even.
- Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

445
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:19,520
And then...

446
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:21,880
we wouldn't have faced that down round...

447
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:26,660
and... we...

448
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:29,120
wouldn't have had to settle for acquisition.

449
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:32,790
All that money...

450
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:35,630
- fucked me.
- Wow. I mean, I don't know about...

451
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:37,490
- Shit!
- Maybe.

452
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:41,340
- Look... Hey.
- No, no, no. We could've done a legit Series B.

453
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:43,440
Right? I'd still be CEO.

454
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:45,840
I'd have my job,

455
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:47,440
my kick-ass house.

456
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:49,510
I'd probably still have my girlfriend...

457
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:51,680
and...

458
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:54,210
- Fuck!
- Okay.

459
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:57,920
Why the fuck didn't anyone
tell me I could take less?

460
00:23:57,950 --> 00:23:59,880
I don't know. I don't know.

461
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,650
- Ideas come up and then...
- Fuck!

462
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:06,180
I'll take a cab, so I'll leave you to it.

463
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:07,650
Thanks for meeting me.

464
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:10,020
Fuck!

465
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:18,760
Richard.

466
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:21,860
Richard, I'm Laurie Bream. I
was inside your home yesterday.

467
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,630
Have you made a decision
regarding our proposal?

468
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:26,140
Uh, yeah, yeah, we'll go with you guys,

469
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:28,700
but we need to renegotiate the terms.

470
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:30,300
Oh, I'm afraid that's untenable.

471
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:31,840
We're offering as much money as we can.

472
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:34,340
No, no, we wanna go lower. We want less...

473
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:36,180
A lot less, actually.

474
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:38,980
We'll go with Raviga if you guys do

475
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:41,350
10 million at a 50 million valuation,

476
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:42,880
not 20 at 100.

477
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:45,180
I think this is more reasonable,

478
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:48,590
and it's my final offer. Take it or leave it.

479
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:50,120
I was not anticipating this,

480
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:54,230
but I think it will be workable from our end.

481
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:58,170
And one more thing... Monica
votes for Raviga's board seat.

482
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:01,670
Certainly that seems unimportant.

483
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,870
I will telephone your lawyer tomorrow,

484
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:06,810
- and we can speak about the relevant details.
- Good.

485
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:18,980
Peter was one of the few
who genuinely took action

486
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:22,210
to use technology to help humanity thrive.

487
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:24,250
But how exactly can we quantify

488
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:28,150
another human's contributions to mankind?

489
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:31,620
Let's break it down into its
three component elements.

490
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:40,830
I met Peter when he was thinking about
investing in my company, Zetasphere,

491
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:45,440
although I think he was hesitant after his
disappointing initial return from Snapchat.

492
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:50,210
He came on board, anyway, and
every month we would meet.

493
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:51,980
Peter was always an honest man,

494
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:54,150
and I know that if Peter
were here with us today,

495
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:57,180
he would say that he was not
disappointed in Snapchat,

496
00:25:57,220 --> 00:26:00,620
and he would forgive you, Lev,
for your misunderstanding.

497
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:03,450
That's just the kind of guy that Peter was...

498
00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:05,820
Warm, generous,

499
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:08,290
and not disappointed in Snapchat.

500
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:18,660
I'll never forget the first time I met Peter.

501
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:20,830
It was in his mom's garage,

502
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:22,500
where we started our
first business together...

503
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:25,740
Manufacturing VGA graphics
cards for IBM clones.

504
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,170
We never looked back.

505
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,800
And you know, the last time I saw him,

506
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:33,070
it was at a restaurant, not a
half-mile away from that same garage.

507
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:34,910
We talked as old friends do.

508
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:37,610
He asked me about Jackson Hole,

509
00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:40,550
I asked him about... Pilates.

510
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:44,360
And yet... something was wrong.

511
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:48,320
Underneath it all, there
was an unmistakable tension.

512
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,390
A tension I will forever regret.

513
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:54,700
It's no secret Peter and
I had our differences.

514
00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:57,130
We let business get between us.

515
00:26:57,170 --> 00:26:58,670
Now?

516
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:01,270
Now I wish I could say I'm sorry for that.

517
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:03,770
It's too late. He's gone,

518
00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:07,980
and it makes me realize the
importance of forgiveness,

519
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:11,510
of doing things with love
and compassion in your heart,

520
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:14,220
and not vengeance and competition.

521
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,890
I mean, we owe that to each other, don't we?

522
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,820
And to him?

523
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:23,590
After all, this valley is the
place Peter himself helped build.

524
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:26,720
Where we come together as dreamers,

525
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:31,000
all of us, to truly make
the world a better place.

526
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:35,100
This is Florence during the Renaissance.

527
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:37,400
This is Camelot.

528
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:41,880
This is the place Peter himself
called "the cradle of innovation."

529
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,410
I will miss my friend.

530
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:51,620
Bye, Pete.

531
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,890
Maybe he is a human, after all.

532
00:28:00,946 --> 00:28:02,259
Sorry.

533
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:05,659
It's from Ron LaFlamme.

534
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:07,459
Gavin Belson is suing you.

535
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:10,220
"Filed claims today that you
stole Pied Piper from Hooli."

536
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:12,060
Shit.

537
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:21,430
Gavin Belson is suing us.

538
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,030
